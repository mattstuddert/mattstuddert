## Hey, I'm Matt, the founder of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

We help people hone their coding skills by providing professionally designed projects to build, and a community to get support and receive feedback from others.

If you're not already in our Discord community, you can [get an invite here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community).

We provide many free challenges, but we also have a [Pro subscription](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro) that allows you to access the Figma files and our highest-quality challenges. Our premium challenges and Figma access help you practice building projects like a professional developer.

We also have [learning paths](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths) to provide a guided route through our challenges and help you go from beginner to job-ready.

Here are some of my favourite free challenge repos if you want to take a look at some of the challenges we offer ðŸ‘‡
